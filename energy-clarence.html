		    	<h1>About the Clarence Department of Energy</h1>
		    	<p>We were formed after the Great Food Riots of 4251, where a burst of anarchy broke out after the monarchy forgetting to give any food or energy to their people while playing anti-gravity golf for three weeks. 
The Miss City at the time, Miss City Petunia, proposed the idea for a government department to handle food and electricity.
<br> We view energy as anything needed to sustain life.
